//The Problem: Working out how many years someone has to work from their age and their retirement age
//General approach:Convert inputs to ints then workout current year, workout the time inbetween their age and retirement age, and add that to the current year
//Main issues: Working out the current year 

int main() {
  string currentAge, retirementAge;
  // Instantiating variables

  cout << "Please enter your current age? ";
  cin >> currentAge;
  cout << "At what age would you like to retire? ";
  cin >> retirementAge;
  //Inputs 

  int currentAgeInt = stoi(currentAge);
  int retirementAgeInt = stoi(retirementAge);
  //Converting inputs to ints

  time_t now = time(0);
  tm * ltm = localtime(&now);
  int currentYear = 1900 + ltm->tm_year;
  //Working out current year

  int yearsWorking = retirementAgeInt - currentAgeInt;
  //Working out the amount of years they have to work
  int retirementYear = yearsWorking + currentYear;
  //Add that to the current year to work out the retirement year

  cout << "\nThe current year is " << currentYear <<", can retire in "<< retirementYear <<"; you have "<< yearsWorking<<" years remaining. \n";
  //Concatinating to create the final output 
  return 0;
